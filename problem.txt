keyword and statistical: 
AI categorizes candidates by identifying industry-specific terms in their CVs to match them with required skills.

Statistical parsing analyzes resumes or job posts with numerical algorithms and understands words and phrases. It identifies addresses and dates and differentiates the same word used differently.

Semantic similarity compares two texts based on meaning or context, not just spelling or grammar.

Sentence transformers use deep learning to create embeddings that capture a sentence's meaning. These embeddings measure the semantic similarity between pairs of sentences using cosine similarity, which compares the words used in each sentence using a mathematical formula and assigns a score indicating their similarity.
